This is the most popular design between the design patterns.Its usage ratio is %80 in terms of International standart.Main purpose of it is just one object is created and always developer can reach it easily.

For instance;
Singleton gives us an oppurtunity to control  object situation which is obtained on the BusinessLayer and is used for CRUD operations.
Other example;
At the creating object step,we want to give a special condition for an object (as Encapsulation),Singleton provides us this process.

Object which is created with Singleton always is stored on the HEAP part of RAM until ISS server reset.That's why we should be carefull when we use singleton.
Developer has two important question before creating object by the Singleton;
1-What is the object job?
2-Do u always use this object?

As a conclusion,object which was created by Singleton can be hazardous when its job is not controlling situation.
