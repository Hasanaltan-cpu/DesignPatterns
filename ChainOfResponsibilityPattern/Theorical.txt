ChainOfResponsibility Pattern

This pattern principle is to derive handler which comes any request with responsible chain.For instance;
Call center.If u call any call center, u wait until reach responsible person.In that scenario,u speak first person who is first caller and u ask for changing but first caller has not responsible for that.Probably,he says "Ok,i will direct u to responsible departmant" and then person who is responsible about ur demand can solve your problem.

This pattern is very common our real life.Every handler connected with responsible handler.But first handler if it has not enough capacity,it can be problem.
