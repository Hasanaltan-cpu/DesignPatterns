# DesignPatterns
In this project, i will demonstrate DesignPatterns.How many way we have and why we need Dependency Injection.

Loosely Coupled
It means classes which is contained with the others should be loosely coupled.Furthermore,if developer wants to change anything in his codes,he can easly change thanks to loosely coupled if they were storngly coupled,he should write every properties of that class again,totally spending time ineffiecently.
Dependency Injection
That's why Dependency injection is used for application which may need some changing one day.Dependency injection can apply with 2 ways;

[Constructor Injection(Constructor Based Dependecy Injection)](https://github.com/Hasanaltan-cpu/DesignPatterns/tree/master/DesignPatterns/Entities/Concrete)

Setter Injection(Setter Based Dependency Injection)
